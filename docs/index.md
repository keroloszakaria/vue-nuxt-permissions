## Why You Need This

Modern applications often struggle with permission and authorization:

- **Scattered permission logic** - Checking permissions across multiple components, routes, and services is messy
- **Inconsistent behavior** - Same permission checks in directives, guards, and components leads to bugs
- **Manual state management** - Managing permissions, caching, and refreshing requires boilerplate code
- **Route protection complexity** - Protecting routes and handling unauthorized access is error-prone
- **Reactive updates** - Updating permissions across the app without full page reload is difficult

**vue-nuxt-permission** solves all of these elegantly.

## Quick Example

### 1. Define Permissions

```ts
// plugins/permission.ts
export default defineNuxtPlugin(() => {
  usePermissionConfig().set({
    permissions: ["read", "write", "admin"],
  });
});
```

### 2. Use in Templates

```vue
<!-- Hide content if user doesn't have permission -->
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Public Section</h1>
    <AdminPanel v-permission="'admin'" />
    <EditButton v-permission="'write'" />
  </div>
</template>
```

### 3. Use in Routes

```ts
// middleware/permissions.ts
export default defineRouteMiddleware((to, from) => {
  if (!hasPermission("admin")) {
    return navigateTo("/");
  }
});
```

### 4. Use in Code

```ts
// composables/useUserActions.ts
const { hasPermission, hasAny } = usePermission();

if (hasPermission("write")) {
  // Allow editing
}

if (hasAny(["admin", "moderator"])) {
  // Show moderation tools
}
```

That's it! Your app now has:

- ✅ Centralized permission management
- ✅ Automatic element visibility control
- ✅ Route-level protection
- ✅ Reactive permission updates
- ✅ Cached persistent permissions

## What Users Experience

**Without vue-nuxt-permission:**

- User sees disabled buttons for actions they can't perform
- Unauthorized routes are accessible but show error states
- Permission checks are duplicated everywhere
- Page reload required to update permissions

**With vue-nuxt-permission:**

- Unauthorized content is removed from DOM completely
- Routes are protected before rendering
- Permission logic defined once, used everywhere
- Permissions update in real-time
- Zero boilerplate code

## Installation

Get started in under a minute:

```bash
npm install vue-nuxt-permission
```

Then check out the [Getting Started](./getting-started) guide.

## When to Use

**Perfect for:**

- Admin dashboards with role-based access control
- SaaS platforms with multiple permission tiers
- Team collaboration apps with granular permissions
- Content management systems with editorial workflows
- Internal tools with feature-based permissions
- Progressive feature rollouts

**Maybe not needed for:**

- Simple public websites (no permission control)
- Apps with only authenticated vs unauthenticated
- One-permission-fits-all scenarios

## Key Concepts

### Permissions

Strings that represent abilities or roles. Examples: `'read'`, `'write'`, `'admin'`, `'moderator'`, `'delete'`.

### Directives

Use `v-permission` to automatically show/hide elements:

```vue
<button v-permission="'delete'">Delete</button>
```

### Composables

Use `usePermission()` to check permissions in JavaScript:

```ts
const { hasPermission, hasAny, hasAll } = usePermission();
```

### Guards

Protect routes with middleware:

```ts
// middleware/admin.ts
export default defineRouteMiddleware((to, from) => {
  if (!hasPermission("admin")) return navigateTo("/");
});
```
